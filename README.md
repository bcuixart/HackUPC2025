# CUPRA TAVASCAN Manual Game
Less manuals, more time, less brain cells!

## Inspiration
When getting a new car, it is important to be familiar with its unique features. However, manuals provided by car manufacturers are usually so daunting, reading them makes anybody want to drive... straight into a lamppost. That is why we've created an application to help people get comfortable with the CUPRA Tavascan’s advanced features in a fun, interactive, and unforgettable manner. 

Our goal is to provide users with a helpful tool to get them to know their new car even before they get to drive it for the first time.

## Application summary
This is an interactive application that showcases some of the CUPRA Tavascan's unique features via a simple multi-choice quiz that represents the thought process of a person who just got the car.

## How it's built
The program is made with C++, using OpenGL for the 3D graphics and QT to create the user interface.

## Challenges we ran into
QT is said to be a pain to work with. The endless tales of pain and misery appear to be true. It was particularly tough trying to grasp how pages work. Eventually, it all clicked and we managed to bring it all together.
This is our first big project together, and that also gave us some problems. Everybody did their part well, but when it came to merging everything, we used extremely outlandish methods and kind of duct-taped all of our parts together. Some members of the team were not familiar with Git and they used Google Drive as a platform to host files. Half the team used Git, the other Google Drive. It was comical, to say the least.

## What we're proud of and learned
This year we're taking a course in computer interfaces. We're learning about QT and OpenGL, and thanks to that, we were able to build the project relatively quickly. But that doesn't mean that we did not learn anything. We've been able to get a much deeper understanding of QT features, particularly Widgets, Pages and Timers. We also got much more comfortable with shaders; in this project we've had to twist our minds and create decently complex shaders with awesome effects.

## What's next for CUPRA TAVASCAN Manual Game
We would have loved to have more time to develop this project. Unfortunately, humans need 8–10 hours of sleep. We only got like 4 in total, but we don't talk about that.
Had we had more time, we would have certainly added more questions, perhaps even randomized questions and answers. As it is right now, it's always the same three questions and the answers do not move around. Possibly the easiest quiz ever.
Other than that, we also would have wished to polish the interface a bit more. It could have used a bit more styling, and we could have fixed some issues when users resize the window.

All in all, we're very satisfied with this project. We hope you like it!
